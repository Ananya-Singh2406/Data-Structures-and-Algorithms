# 🐍 My DSA Journey: Python Solutions for Technical Interviews

## 🚀 Project Goal

This repository serves as a structured log of my progress through essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The primary goal is to master fundamental DSA patterns, implement solutions with optimal complexity, and build a reliable resource for technical interview preparation.

## ✨ Key Features

1.  **🧭 Structured Learning Path:** Problems are organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Dynamic Programming) to facilitate focused study and mastery of specific concepts.
2.  **🐍 Python Implementation:** All solutions are implemented in **Python**, utilizing language-specific features for clean, idiomatic code.
3.  **📚 Detailed Documentation:** Every solution file or folder includes:
    * A link back to the original problem (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
    * Notes on the core **Intuition** and **Optimal Approach**.
    * Complexity Analysis (Time and Space).
4.  **🎯 Optimal Solutions:** Each solution is optimized to achieve the best possible Time and Space Complexity.

## 🗺️ Problem Categories

My solutions are grouped into the following high-value categories, ensuring comprehensive coverage of topics frequently seen in interviews:

| Category | Focus Area | Essential Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Foundations** | Arrays & Strings | Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Hash Tables |
| **II. Recursion & Search** | Trees & Graphs | DFS, BFS, Binary Search Tree (BST), Tries, Backtracking |
| **III. Optimization** | Dynamic Programming (DP) | Memoization, Tabulation, Greedy Algorithms |
| **IV. Advanced DS** | Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues | Fast & Slow Pointer, Monotonic Stack, Priority Queues |
| **V. Specialized** | Sorting & Bit Manipulation | Merge Sort, Quick Sort, XOR Operations |
